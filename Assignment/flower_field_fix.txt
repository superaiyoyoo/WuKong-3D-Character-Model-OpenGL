/*
FIX FOR FLOWER FIELD BACKGROUND ISSUE

The issue is that the renderFlowerFieldBackground() function is never called 
in the display() function, so pressing '4' toggles flowerFieldEnabled but 
nothing visually changes.

SOLUTION:
In the display() function, after the line:
    drawBackground();

Add the following lines:
    
    // Render flower field background if enabled
    if (flowerFieldEnabled) {
        renderFlowerFieldBackground();
    }

This will ensure that when flowerFieldEnabled is set to true (by pressing '4'),
the flower field background will actually be rendered and visible.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
You could also modify the drawBackground() function to include the flower field
rendering directly, or create a combined background rendering function.

The key issue is that the toggle variable flowerFieldEnabled is being set correctly,
but the actual rendering function renderFlowerFieldBackground() is never called
to display the flower field background.
